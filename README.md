# 🎉 Beautiful Birthday Surprise Website 🎂

This is a lovingly crafted birthday website created as a special surprise for my girlfriend on her 18th birthday. It’s designed to be visually charming, interactive, and filled with pastel colors, floating images, animated hearts, and a heartfelt letter.

## 💖 Features

- 🎈 Floating heart animations and image gallery for a dreamy effect
- 🔒 PIN-protected access for a private and secure surprise experience
- 🎁 Surprise message and letter revealed on button click
